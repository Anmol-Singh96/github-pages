# Indian Wind Code IS 875:2015 – Detailed Summary  

---

## **Clause 1: Scope**  
- Applies to **static and dynamic wind load assessment** for structures up to 200m height.  
- Covers **special structures** (e.g., towers, bridges, chimneys) and **components** (cladding, roofing).  
- Integrates wind loads with other loads (dead, seismic) using **limit state design principles**.  

---

## **Clause 2: Terminology**  
- **Basic Wind Speed (Vb):** 3-second gust speed at 10m height in open terrain (Zone II: 33 m/s to Zone VI: 55 m/s).  
- **Terrain Categories:**  
  - Category 1: Open terrain (e.g., flat plains).  
  - Category 2: Rural with scattered obstructions.  
  - Category 3: Suburban/industrial areas.  
  - Category 4: Dense urban areas.  
- **Pressure Coefficients (Cpe, Cpi):** External and internal pressures based on geometry and openings.  
- **Gust Effect Factor (G):** Accounts for turbulence-induced dynamic effects.  

---

## **Clause 3: Wind Data and Basic Wind Speed**  
- **Wind Zones:** India divided into 6 zones (II to VI) with mapped Vb values.  
- **Probability Factor (K1):** Adjusts for design life (e.g., 1.0 for 50 years, 1.15 for 100 years).  
- **Directionality Factor (Kd):** 0.9 (non-directional) or 1.0 (directional analysis).  

---

## **Clause 4: Design Wind Speed and Pressure**  
- **Design Wind Speed (Vz):**  Vz = Vb × K1 × K2 × K3 × K4
- **K2 (Terrain/Height Factor):** Reduces wind speed with terrain roughness and height.  
- **K3 (Topography Factor):** ≥1.0 for slopes/hills (e.g., 1.2 for 30° slopes).  
- **K4 (Cyclonic Factor):** 1.0 (non-cyclonic) to 1.3 (cyclonic zones like coastal Odisha).  
- **Design Wind Pressure (Pd):**  Pd = 0.6 × Vz² (in Pascals)

---

## **Clause 5: Wind Force Calculations**  
- **Net Pressure:**  p = Pd × (Cpe - Cpi) × Ka
- **Ka (Area Averaging Factor):** Reduces pressure for large surfaces (e.g., 0.8 for 100m²).  
- **Force Coefficient (Cf):** For lattice structures (e.g., Cf = 2.0 for flat-sided towers).  
- **Internal Pressure (Cpi):**  
- ±0.5 for buildings with dominant openings.  
- ±0.2 for enclosed structures.  

---

## **Clause 6: Dynamic Effects**  
- **Gust Effect Factor (G):**  G = 1 + gf × √[B(1 + φ)]
- **gf (Peak Factor):** ~3.5–4.0.  
- **B (Background Turbulence):** Depends on structure size and wind spectrum.  
- **Along-Wind Response:** Limits peak acceleration to 15–25 milli-g for occupant comfort in tall buildings.  

---

## **Clause 7: Special Structures and Elements**  
- **Towers/Chimneys:** Force coefficients vary with slenderness ratio (height/diameter).  
- **Rooftop Equipment:**  
- Solar panels: Cpe = ±1.5.  
- Anchorage design for uplift forces.  
- **Hyperbolic Cooling Towers:** Cpe = -0.8 on windward face.  

---

## **Clause 8: Load Combinations**  
- **Partial Safety Factors:**  
- 1.5 for wind in ultimate limit states (IS 456/IS 800).  
- Combines wind with dead/live/seismic loads.  

---

## **Clause 9: Wind Tunnel Testing**  
- Required for:  
- **Unusual geometries** (e.g., domes, long-span roofs).  
- **Complex terrains** (hills, dense urban canyons).  
- Validation must align with code provisions.  

---

## **Appendices**  
- **Appendix A:** Wind zone map of India.  
- **Appendix B:** Worked examples (e.g., force calculation for a 50m tower).  
- **Appendix C:** Methodology for dynamic response analysis.  

---

## **Key Considerations**  
- **Directional Analysis:** Requires wind rose data but allows lower Vb.  
- **Cyclonic Regions:** Coastal zones (e.g., Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu) use K4 = 1.15–1.3.  
- **Occupant Comfort:** Tall buildings (>100m) require dynamic analysis for acceleration limits.
