**Design Loads (Other than Earthquake) for Buildings and Structures — Wind Loads**

## 1. Scope  
- **Objective**: Provides guidelines for calculating static and dynamic wind loads on buildings, structures, and components.  
- **Static Analysis**: Suitable for conventional structures (e.g., low-rise buildings).  
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Mandatory for tall/slender structures (e.g., skyscrapers, chimneys, towers).  
- **Special Cases**: Includes structures under construction and cyclone-prone regions.  
- **Exclusions**: Unconventional geometries or extreme environmental conditions require specialized studies.

## 4. Terminology  
- **Angle of Attack**: Angle between wind direction and structure’s reference axis.  
- **Terrain Categories**:  
  - **Category 1**: Open terrain (e.g., flat plains, coasts).  
  - **Category 4**: Dense urban areas (e.g., city centers).  
- **Turbulence Intensity**: Ratio of wind speed fluctuations to mean wind speed.  
- **Return Period**: Statistical likelihood of extreme wind speeds (e.g., 50-year return period = 2% annual exceedance probability).

## 5. General Wind Characteristics  
- **Wind Behavior**:  
  - Gusts impact cladding, roofing, and slender elements.  
  - Cyclones dominate coastal regions (e.g., Gujarat, Odisha).  
- **Pressure Effects**:  
  - **External**: Windward (positive) and leeward (negative) pressures.  
  - **Internal**: Depends on building permeability (e.g., ±0.2 for normal openings).  
- **Human Comfort**: Limit vibrations in tall buildings (e.g., peak acceleration ≤ 0.15 m/s²).

## 6. Wind Speed Determination  
### 6.1–6.2 Basic Wind Speed  
- **Map-Based**: `V_b` derived from 50-year return period map (Fig. 1).  
  - **Examples**:  
    | City          | `V_b` (m/s) |  
    |---------------|-------------|  
    | Kolkata       | 50          |  
    | Mumbai        | 44          |  
    | Bengaluru     | 33          |  

### 6.3 Design Wind Speed (`V_z`)  
- **Formula**:
- V_z = V_b × k₁ × k₂ × k₃ × k₄
- **`k₁` (Risk Coefficient)**: Adjusts for structure lifespan (Table 1).  
  - Hospitals (100-year life): `k₁ = 1.08`.  
  - Temporary sheds (5-year life): `k₁ = 0.67`.  
- **`k₂` (Terrain Factor)**: Height-dependent (Table 2).  
  - At 50m height:  
    - Category 1: `k₂ = 1.20`.  
    - Category 4: `k₂ = 1.10`.  
- **`k₃` (Topography Factor)**: Up to `1.36` for hills/escarpments (Annex C).  
- **`k₄` (Cyclone Factor)**: `1.30` for shelters, `1.15` for industries.  

### 6.4–6.6 Turbulence and Offshore Winds  
- **Turbulence Intensity**: Higher in urban areas (Category 4).  
- **Offshore Winds**: 15% higher than coastal speeds (e.g., offshore platforms).

## 7. Wind Pressure and Force Calculations  
### 7.2 Design Wind Pressure (`p_z`)  
- **Formula**:
- p_z = 0.6 × V_z² (N/m²)
- **Adjustments**:  
- **Directionality (`K_d`)**: `0.9` for rectangular buildings.  
- **Area Averaging (`K_a`)**: Reduces pressure for large surfaces (Table 4).  

### 7.3 Pressure Coefficients  
- **External Pressure (`C_pe`)**:  
- **Walls**: Varies with wind angle (Table 5).  
- **Pitched Roofs**: Suction up to `-2.0` at edges (Table 6).  
- **Cylinders**: Negative pressures dominate (Table 19).  
- **Internal Pressure (`C_pi`)**:  
- Normal permeability: `±0.2`.  
- Large openings: `±0.7`.  

### 7.4 Force Coefficients  
- **Drag Force (`C_f`)**:  
- Rectangular buildings: `1.2–1.4` (depends on aspect ratio).  
- Circular structures: Varies with Reynolds number (Annex D).

## 8. Interference Effects  
- **Tall Buildings**:  
- **Zones Z1–Z4**: Proximity amplifies loads (Fig. 8).  
- **Interference Factor (`IF`)**: Up to `1.35` in Zone Z1.  
- **Low-Rise Buildings**: Up to 25% load increase for spacing <5× width.  

---

## 9. Dynamic Effects  
- **Vortex Shedding**:  
- Critical for circular structures (e.g., chimneys).  
- **Frequency**: `f_s = (St × V_z) / D`, where `St` (Strouhal number) = `0.2` (subcritical flow).  
- **Galloping/Flutter**:  
- Affects non-circular shapes (e.g., square towers).  

---

## 10. Dynamic Wind Response  
### 10.2 Along-Wind Gust Response  
- **Gust Factor (`G`)**: Combines turbulence and resonance effects.  
- **Peak Acceleration**: Limited to `0.15 m/s²` for human comfort.  

### 10.3 Across-Wind Response  
- **Base Bending Moment**: Calculated using turbulence spectrum and mode shape.

## Annexes  
- **Annex A**: Basic wind speeds for 50+ Indian cities.  
- **Annex C**: Topography factor (`k₃`) for hills/escarpments.  
- **Annex D**: Wind force on circular sections (subcritical vs. supercritical flow).

## Practical Implications for Designers  
1. **Site-Specific Analysis**: Terrain and topography significantly influence wind loads.  
2. **Dynamic Sensitivity**: Ensure natural frequency >1 Hz for tall structures.  
3. **Cyclone Zones**: Use `k₄ = 1.30` for coastal shelters.  
4. **Urban Interference**: Account for adjacent structures in dense areas.
