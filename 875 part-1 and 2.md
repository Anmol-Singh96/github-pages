## **IS 875 Part 1: Dead Loads**  

### **Table 1: Clause Summary**  
| Clause No. | Description |  
|------------|--------------|  
| **1** | **Scope and Application**: Applies to all buildings/structures. Specifies methods to calculate dead loads (permanent loads from materials, finishes, and fixed equipment). |  
| **2** | **Definitions**: Defines "dead load" (static, permanent) and "unit weight" (weight per unit volume, e.g., kN/m³). |  
| **3** | **General Guidelines**: Dead loads must include self-weight, finishes, partitions, and fixed services. |  
| **4** | **Unit Weights of Materials**: Lists densities for concrete, masonry, steel, timber, etc. |  
| **5** | **Loads from Walls**: Calculated based on material, thickness, and height. |  
| **6** | **Loads from Floors**: Includes slab weight, screeds, and finishes. |  
| **7** | **Loads from Roofs**: Covers roofing materials (tiles, waterproofing) and fixtures (solar panels). |  
| **8** | **Partitions**: Fixed partitions use actual weight; movable partitions may be treated as live loads. |  
| **9** | **Services**: Includes HVAC, plumbing, and electrical installations. |  
| **10** | **Fixed Equipment**: Requires project-specific calculations (e.g., heavy machinery). |  
| **11** | **Combination with Other Loads**: Dead loads combined with live/wind/snow loads per IS 875:Part 5. |

|-----------------------------|------------------|----------|  
| Reinforced Concrete         | 24–25 kN/m³      | kN/m³    |  
| Brick Masonry               | 18–20 kN/m³      | kN/m³    |  
| Floor Finishes              | 0.5–1.5 kN/m²    | kN/m²    |  
| Steel                       | 78.5 kN/m³       | kN/m³    |  
| Plaster                     | 20–22 kN/m³      | kN/m³    |  
| Fixed Partitions            | 1–2 kN/m²        | kN/m²    |  
| Roof Waterproofing          | 0.2–0.5 kN/m²    | kN/m²    |  
| Services (HVAC, Plumbing)   | 0.5–1 kN/m²      | kN/m²    |

## **IS 875 Part 2: Imposed (Live) Loads**  

### **Table 3: Clause Summary**  
| Clause No. | Description |  
|------------|--------------|  
| **1** | **Scope**: Applies to buildings based on occupancy (residential, commercial, industrial). |  
| **2** | **Definitions**: Defines "imposed loads" (temporary, dynamic) and types (UDL, concentrated loads). |  
| **3** | **Classification of Buildings**: Groups structures by occupancy type (e.g., offices, warehouses). |  
| **4** | **Imposed Loads by Occupancy**: Specifies UDL and concentrated loads for different occupancies. |  
| **5** | **Reduction for Large Areas**: Allows live load reduction for floors >50 m² using a formula. |  
| **6** | **Stairs and Balconies**: Higher loads for stairs (3–5 kN/m²) and balconies (3–4 kN/m²). |  
| **7** | **Impact Loads**: Dynamic forces from moving loads (e.g., elevators) with impact factors. |  
| **8** | **Machinery Loads**: Requires project-specific data for heavy machinery. |  
| **9** | **Load Combinations**: Combines live loads with dead/wind/earthquake loads per IS 456. |

| **Load Type**               | **Value/Range**          | **Unit**       |  
|-----------------------------|--------------------------|----------------|  
| Residential Floors          | 2–3 kN/m²                | kN/m² (UDL)    |  
| Office Floors               | 3–4 kN/m²                | kN/m² (UDL)    |  
| Retail Spaces               | 4–5 kN/m²                | kN/m² (UDL)    |  
| Warehouses                  | 5–10 kN/m²               | kN/m² (UDL)    |  
| Stairs                      | 3–5 kN/m²                | kN/m² (UDL)    |  
| Balconies                   | 3–4 kN/m²                | kN/m² (UDL)    |

### **Key Notes**:  
1. **Dead Loads**: Permanent loads calculated using material unit weights (e.g., concrete = 25 kN/m³).  
2. **Imposed Loads**: Variable loads dependent on occupancy; UDL values specified for floors, stairs, and balconies.  
3. **Units**:  
   - Dead Loads: kN/m³ (material density) or kN/m² (distributed loads).  
   - Imposed Loads: kN/m² (UDL) or kN (concentrated loads).  

> **Note**: For precise design, always refer to the latest IS 875 documents and consult a structural engineer.
