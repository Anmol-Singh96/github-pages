## Clause 6: GENERAL PRINCIPLES & DESIGN ASSUMPTIONS

### 6.1 General Principles
- **Ground Motion**:  
  Earthquakes shake buildings horizontally (side-to-side) and vertically (up-down). Horizontal shaking is usually stronger, but vertical shaking can destabilize structures like bridges, dams, or buildings with large overhangs.
- **Structural Response**:  
  How a building reacts to shaking depends on its foundation, materials (e.g., concrete vs. steel), and soil type. Buildings on soft soil (like loose sand or clay) shake more violently than those on rock.
- **Ductility & Overstrength**:  
  - **Ductility**: Buildings must bend and flex without collapsing. Think of it like a tree swaying in the wind.
  - **Overstrength**: Hidden strength reserves in materials (e.g., extra reinforcement in concrete) to handle forces stronger than predicted.
- **Soil-Structure Interaction**:  
  Soft soils amplify shaking, so foundations must be designed carefully. On rock/hard soil, this effect is ignored.

### 6.2 Assumptions
1. **Resonance**:  
   Rarely occurs (except in tall buildings on soft soil, where shaking frequency matches the building’s natural sway).
2. **No Combined Extreme Loads**:  
   Earthquakes are assumed *not* to happen alongside worst-case winds or floods.
3. **Material Behavior**:  
   Use standard stiffness values unless advanced testing is done.

### 6.3 Load Combinations & Design
- **Horizontal Loads**:  
  Buildings must resist full sideways force in one direction (e.g., left-right) plus 30% of the force from the perpendicular direction (e.g., front-back).
- **Vertical Loads**:  
  Critical for bridges, tall buildings, or soft soil. Vertical shaking reduces effective weight, risking collapse of heavy elements like beams.
- **3D Shaking**:  
  Combine forces from all directions (left-right, front-back, up-down) but assume only 30% contribution from the less critical directions.
- **Foundation Design**:  
  - **Rock/Hard Soil**: Can safely handle 50% more load during earthquakes.
  - **Soft Soil**: No extra load allowed—use deep piles anchored in stable layers.
  - **Soil Testing**: Use the Standard Penetration Test (SPT) to check soil strength. Poor soils (low SPT values) need ground improvement.

### 6.4 Design Acceleration Spectrum
- **Seismic Zones**:  
  The country is split into 4 zones (II to V). Zone V has the highest earthquake risk.
- **Soil Types**:  
  - **Type I (Rock/Hard)**: Stable, minimal shaking.
  - **Type II (Medium)**: Stiff clay or dense sand—moderate shaking.
  - **Type III (Soft)**: Loose sand or soft clay—intense shaking.
- **Design Force**:  
  Calculated based on:
  - **Zone Risk** (higher zones = stronger forces).
  - **Building Importance** (hospitals = 1.5× importance factor; houses = 1.0×).
  - **Soil Type** (soft soil = higher forces).
- **Underground Structures**:  
  Deeper parts (below 30m) experience half the shaking force. For depths between 0–30m, forces reduce gradually.

### Key Concepts
1. **Ductility Saves Lives**:  
   Buildings that bend (e.g., steel frames, well-reinforced concrete) survive better than brittle ones.
2. **Soil Dictates Safety**:  
   Soft soils are risky—avoid them for critical structures or use deep foundations.
3. **Zones & Importance**:  
   High-risk zones (IV/V) and critical buildings (hospitals) need stricter design.
4. **Load Combinations**:  
   Design for shaking in all directions, but prioritize the strongest forces.

**Practical Example**:  
A hospital in Zone V on soft soil would need:  
- Deep piles to anchor it in stable soil.  
- Extra reinforcement (ductile design) to handle bending.  
- Higher design forces (1.5× importance factor).

## Clause 7: EARTHQUAKE LOADS, ANALYSIS, AND DESIGN METHODS

*Note: Sub-clause headings have been formatted with a smaller heading level to ensure a professional, uniform text size.*

#### 7.2 Minimum Design Earthquake Horizontal Lateral Force
Specifies zone-dependent lateral force percentages (ρ) for buildings. Higher seismic zones (e.g., Zone V) require greater lateral forces to account for increased earthquake risk. This ensures buildings are designed to withstand minimum seismic forces proportional to regional hazard levels.

#### 7.2.3 Importance Factor (I)
Assigns higher importance factors to critical buildings (hospitals, schools, emergency facilities: **I=1.5**) and large residential/commercial structures (**I=1.2**). This encourages conservative design for high-occupancy or essential buildings, with flexibility for owners to adopt stricter values.

#### 7.2.4 Damping Ratio
Mandates a 5% damping ratio for all buildings, irrespective of construction material. This accounts for energy dissipation during inelastic deformations under earthquakes, applicable to both static and dynamic analysis methods.

#### 7.2.5 Design Acceleration Spectrum
Defines normalized acceleration coefficients based on soil type and structural period. Soil–structure interaction is considered, with detailed calculations referenced in Section 6.4.2.

#### 7.2.6 Response Reduction Factor (R)
Rewards ductile and redundant structural systems with higher **R-values** (e.g., special moment frames: **R=5** vs. ordinary frames: **R=3**). This encourages designs that absorb energy through controlled deformation rather than brittle failure.

#### 7.2.7 Dual System
Requires combining moment-resisting frames with structural walls/bracings. Both systems share lateral forces proportionally, with frames independently resisting ≥25% of the base shear, thereby enhancing redundancy and system reliability.

#### 7.3 Imposed Loads for Seismic Weight
- **Floor Loads**: 25–50% of imposed loads (based on intensity) contribute to seismic weight.
- **Roof Loads**: Excludes general roof loads but includes permanently fixed equipment.
- **Adjustments**: Allows site-specific load assessments, provided they meet minimum standards.

#### 7.3.6 Interior Partition Weight
Includes partition weights (≥0.5 kN/m²) in seismic calculations, ensuring inertial effects are accounted for, though partitions do not contribute to structural resistance.

#### 7.4 Seismic Weight
- **Floor Weight**: Full dead load plus apportioned imposed loads.
- **Column/Wall Weights**: Distributed to adjacent floors.
- **Mid-Storey Weights**: Allocated inversely to the distance from floors.

#### 7.6 Equivalent Static Method
A simplified approach for **regular buildings <15 m in Zone II**:
1. Compute total base shear ($V_B$) using seismic weight and the acceleration coefficient.
2. Distribute $V_B$ vertically based on floor masses.
3. Allocate forces horizontally via diaphragm action.

#### 7.6.1 Design Base Shear
$V_B$ depends on:
- **Horizontal Acceleration Coefficient ($A_h$)**: Derived from soil type and natural period.
- **Seismic Weight ($W$)**: Total building mass.

#### 7.6.2 Natural Period Estimation
Varies by structural system:
- **Bare MRF**: Shorter period for RC versus steel frames.
- **RC Walls**: Period depends on wall area and building geometry.
- **Other Buildings**: Simplified formula using height and base dimensions.

#### 7.6.3 Base Shear Distribution
- **Vertical**: Proportional to floor mass and height.
- **Horizontal**: Rigid diaphragms distribute forces based on element stiffness; flexible diaphragms require deformation analysis.

#### 7.7 Dynamic Analysis Method
Mandatory for **irregular/tall buildings (≥15 m in Zones III–V)**:
- **Time History Method**: Uses site-specific ground motion records.
- **Response Spectrum Method**: Applies standardized/site-specific spectra.
- **Safety Check**: Dynamic base shear must be ≥ the static method value.

#### 7.7.5 Modal Analysis
- **Natural Modes**: Identify the building’s vibration patterns.
- **Mode Combination**: Ensures cumulative forces account for all significant modes (using CQC/SRSS methods).
- **Simplified Analysis**: Lumped mass model for regular buildings.

#### 7.8 Torsion
Addresses rotational forces due to misalignment between mass and stiffness centers.
- **Design Eccentricity**: Combines static and accidental offsets (with 1.5× amplification for dynamic cases).

#### 7.9 RC Frames with URM Infills
- **Modeling**: Infill walls are modeled as diagonal struts.
- **Stiffness/Strength**: Ensures uniformity to avoid weak stories.

#### 7.10 Open Storeys
Mitigates weak/soft stories by reinforcing open levels with RC walls or braced frames. Requirements include:
- ≥80% stiffness and ≥90% strength relative to adjacent floors.
- 2% RC wall density in high seismic zones.

#### 7.11 Deformation Control
- **Storey Drift**: Limited to 0.4% of the storey height to prevent damage.
- **Separation Distance**: Prevents pounding between buildings using amplified displacements ($R \times \Delta$).

#### 7.12 Non-Structural Elements
- **Foundations**: Bans weak systems in soft soils; requires ties in high seismic zones.
- **Cantilevers**: Designed for 5× seismic forces.
- **Compound Walls**: Conservative design ($A_h = 1.25Z$).
- **Connections**: Secure all components to resist ≥5% of loads.

#### Key Philosophy
1. **Regularity**: Avoid plan/vertical irregularities.
2. **Ductility**: Prioritize systems that deform without failing.
3. **Redundancy**: Dual systems and load-sharing ensure reliability.
4. **Safety Margins**: Conservative assumptions for uncertainties.
