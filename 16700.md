- **1.3 Occupancy Limits:**  
  - Applies to buildings housing up to 20,000 persons.  

- **1.4 Extended Use:**

## Conclusion  
IS 16700:2023 lays out a comprehensive, layered approach—from broad design criteria to detailed sub-clause requirements—that ensures tall reinforced concrete buildings are safe, serviceable, and resilient against environmental and seismic forces. By clearly defining both major clauses and the essential sub-clauses, the standard provides a robust framework for engineers to design buildings that meet stringent safety and performance standards.
