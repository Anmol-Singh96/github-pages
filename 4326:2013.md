# Detailed Summary of IS 4326:2013

**Earthquake Resistant Design and Construction of Buildings – Code of Practice (Third Revision)**  
This Indian Standard provides guidelines for designing and constructing buildings that can resist earthquake forces. It covers conventional building types including those constructed with masonry (using rectangular units), timber, and structures with precast flooring/roofing elements. Separate standards exist for low-strength masonry and earthen buildings.

---

## 1. Scope  
- **1.1 General Scope:**  
  - Addresses material selection, design features, and construction practices for earthquake resistant buildings.
  - Applies to conventional building types such as masonry (brick/stone/RC masonry), timber, and buildings with prefabricated components.
- **1.2 Exclusions:**  
  - Buildings using low-strength masonry or earthen construction are covered in separate standards.

---

## 2. References  
- The standard incorporates provisions from several other Indian Standards, including:  
  - **IS 456:** Plain and reinforced concrete – Code of practice.  
  - **IS 883:** Code of practice for design of structural timber in buildings.  
  - **IS 1077, IS 2185 (Part 1):** Specifications for building bricks and concrete blocks.  
  - **IS 1893 (Part 1):** Criteria for earthquake resistant design of structures.  
  - **IS 13920:** Ductility detailing of reinforced concrete structures subjected to seismic forces.  
  - And others related to fire safety, foundation design, and welding practices.

---

## 3. Terminology  
- **Separation Section:**  
  - A gap between adjacent buildings or parts of the same building to avoid collision (pounding) during an earthquake.
- **Crumple Section:**  
  - A gap filled with material designed to crumple or fracture in an earthquake, thereby dissipating energy.
- **Centre of Rigidity:**  
  - The point in a structure where lateral forces produce equal deflections.
- **Shear Wall & Box System:**  
  - A shear wall resists lateral loads in its plane; a box system uses walls that also act as the load-resisting system.
- **Band:**  
  - A reinforced runner (RC or brickwork) provided in walls to tie them together and impart horizontal strength.
- **Seismic Coefficients:**  
  - The basic and design horizontal seismic coefficients used for calculating earthquake forces based on the seismic zone (as defined in IS 1893).

---

## 4. General Principles  
- **Lightness:**  
  - Minimize the building’s weight, especially in roofs and upper storeys, to reduce seismic forces.
- **Continuity of Construction:**  
  - Ensure all parts of the building are tied together so that the structure behaves as a single unit.
- **Avoidance of Projecting/Suspended Parts:**  
  - Projecting elements should be minimized or, if necessary, adequately reinforced and tied to the main structure.
- **Building Configuration:**  
  - Prefer symmetrical, rectangular plans to align the centres of mass and rigidity; if asymmetry exists, provide separation or crumple sections to mitigate torsion.
- **Strength & Ductility:**  
  - Structural elements and connections must be designed for ductile failure, enabling energy absorption without sudden collapse. Reinforcement details should follow IS 13920.
- **Foundation & Soil Conditions:**  
  - Buildings must be founded on soils that do not subside or liquefy; special attention is given to foundation continuity and connection.

## 5. Special Construction Features  
### 5.1 Separation of Adjoining Structures  
- **Purpose:**  
  - Prevent collision (pounding) during an earthquake by maintaining proper gap widths.
- **Requirements:**  
  - Minimum gap widths are specified (with reference to a table) based on the construction type and design seismic coefficient.
- **Dynamic Considerations:**  
  - For taller buildings (e.g., >40 m), dynamic analysis may be required to determine appropriate gap widths.

### 5.2 Separation or Crumple Sections  
- **For Framed Constructions:**  
  - Structural members are duplicated on either side of the separation or crumple section, or the adjacent portions are designed to act as cantilevers.
- **Detailing:**  
  - Typical joint and connection details are provided (with reference to figures and IS 3414).

### 5.3 Foundations  
- **General Approach:**  
  - Follow IS 1904 and IS 1893 (Part 1) for foundation design.
- **Soil Uniformity:**  
  - Ideally, the subgrade should be uniform; otherwise, separation or crumple sections may be necessary.
- **Special Measures:**  
  - In soft soils, measures like sand piling or soil stabilization are recommended.
- **Isolated Footings:**  
  - Individual footings must be connected by RC ties (with specified minimum dimensions) to prevent differential movement.

### 5.4 Roofs and Floors  
- **Flat Roofs/Floors:**  
  - Should not be made of loosely supported materials; proper blocking, bridging, and securement of joists are essential.
- **Pitched Roofs:**  
  - Preference is given to materials (e.g., corrugated iron or asbestos sheets) that are light and securely anchored.

### 5.5 Staircases  
- **Types:**  
  - Separated staircases (with sliding joints), built-in staircases (with rigid enclosures), or staircases with sliding joints are detailed to prevent inadvertent bracing effects on the floor system.

## 6. Types of Construction  
### 6.1 Framed Construction  
- **Vertical Load Carrying Frame:**  
  - Consists of frames with hinged joints and bracing; common in steel and timber buildings.
- **Moment Resistant Frames with Shear Walls:**  
  - Combines frames with rigid shear walls to resist lateral forces. Frames are designed to carry a specified minimum percentage of the lateral load.
  
### 6.2 Box Type Construction  
- **Definition:**  
  - Uses continuous masonry walls (or a combination of prefabricated/in-situ masonry) that act both as vertical load carriers and as lateral force resisting elements.

---

## 7. Categories of Buildings  
- **Classification:**  
  - Buildings are categorized (Categories B to E) based on the seismic zone and the building’s importance factor.
- **Usage:**  
  - These categories determine the specific seismic detailing and strengthening measures required.

---

## 8. Masonry Construction with Rectangular Masonry Units  
### 8.1 Masonry Units and Mortar  
- **Units:**  
  - Well-burnt bricks, concrete blocks, or stone masonry may be used, with strength requirements based on the number of storeys and wall thickness.
- **Mortar:**  
  - Specified mortar mixes are recommended for proper bonding and strength.

### 8.2 Masonry Walls  
- **Bearing Walls:**  
  - Should be reinforced (where necessary) and designed to resist lateral loads; wall thickness and symmetry are important.
- **Openings:**  
  - Guidelines for the size, position, and reinforcement of openings (doors, windows) are provided to maintain structural integrity.

### 8.3 Strengthening Arrangements  
- **Reinforcement Bands:**  
  - Lintel bands, roof bands, and gable bands are provided to tie walls together and improve horizontal strength.
- **Vertical Reinforcement:**  
  - Vertical bars at corners, junctions, and jambs of openings are specified (with reference to tables and figures) to enhance ductility.
- **Detailed Requirements:**  
  - Tables specify minimum reinforcement details based on building category and number of storeys.

## 10. Timber Construction  
### 10.1 General Guidelines  
- **Material & Design:**  
  - Timber construction must conform to IS 883, with emphasis on lightness, strength, and proper connection detailing.
- **Storey Limits:**  
  - Typically restricted to two storeys (with or without an attic floor).

### 10.2 Framing Systems  
- **Stud Wall Construction:**  
  - Timber studs and posts form load-bearing walls; maximum spacing and minimum sizes are specified (with reference to tables).
